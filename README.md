An After Effects "aerenader" front end that supports watch folder style rendering for primarily frame based projects

This version of the script was used successfully in production across 8 workstations, each with 3-5 instances of aerender running. This was in full production for AE CC in 2013.

More info and some associated tools still to come. If you want more info or to use this, contact me here
